# Programming Project

## Analyzing the Covid-19

This project covers some interesting features of Covid-19 dataset, taken from
Our World In Data [repository](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/).

The topic of the analysis was to find some interesting insights about the spread
of the disease: in particular, the study tried to cover the correlation between
the spread of new cases with the stringency operated by local governments, or
the number of deaths related to a country's population median age.

The project began on the local machine, but in the middle of the scripting the
computation and the visualization were more effective on Google Colaboratory, so
in the end the project has been uploaded on the notebook, and then on Github.
